ASSIGNMENT 2 

My android app displays flashcards of different questions a user to study with and by answering all questions correctly. The app is to develop using Kotlin and Android Studio. The code structure of the app considers MainActivity handles users input and updates the UI. 

Layout / Activity_main.xml defines the UI layout for the main activity. Therefore, the app launches Main Activity. Kt, which fills the Text display like written in my application with questionnaires. Then when the user clicks start button questions appear (e.g. “Khoisan eat wild bar, beer, Rabbitts, and partridge?”, “The Khoisan real name is Khoisan?”, ext.) Main Activity handles the click events and updates the UI accordingly. 

 

Button Click Event 

Start quiz button: when you start to click the “start” button it would then take you to the next page with questions. 

True/false button: the “true/false” button give you an option to select if the questions that appear is true or false 

Next button: it slides you to the “next question” after you have answered then also would be showing you which of your questions you have got correctly, and which are wrong.
